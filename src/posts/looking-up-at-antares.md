 I looked up at Antares
<br/>
 but Antares did nothing to acknowledge me.
<br/>
 I looked down at the dandelion
<br/>
 and it could care less.
<br/>
 I walked toward a tree and scared half a dozen birds.
<br/>
 I stepped on ants, scared a harmless snake and
<br/>
 a gecko left left its tail behind,
<br/>
 for me to find
<br/>
nature is simply a brief diversion from
<br/>
what lies beyond this precious moment.
